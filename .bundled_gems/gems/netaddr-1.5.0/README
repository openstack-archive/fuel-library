=Introduction

NetAddr arose through my need as a network engineer for a 
back-end module that could easily handle such advanced tasks 
as automating the subnetting/supernetting
of IP space, performing calculations on IP CIDR blocks, and other
various items. At that time there were no modules that could
do any of the things that I needed, so I set out to create my own. 
Since it has proven to be fairly useful to me, I have decided to share the
code with the Ruby community. 
 
I have added things that I find immediately useful for me. I am
open to suggestions if there is something that I could add to make
your life easier.
