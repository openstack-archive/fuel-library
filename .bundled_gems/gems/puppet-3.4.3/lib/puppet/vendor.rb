module Puppet
  # Simple module to manage vendored code.
  #
  # To vendor a library:
  #
  # * Download its whole git repo or untar into `lib/puppet/vendor/<libname>`
  # * Create a lib/puppetload_libraryname.rb file to add its libdir into the $:.
  #   (Look at existing load_xxx files, they should all follow the same pattern).
  # * To load the vendored lib upfront, add a `require '<vendorlib>'`line to
  #   `vendor/require_vendored.rb`.
  # * To load the vendored lib on demand, add a comment to `vendor/require_vendored.rb`
  #    to make it clear it should not be loaded upfront.
  #
  # At runtime, the #load_vendored method should be called. It will ensure
  # all vendored libraries are added to the global `$:` path, and
  # will then call execute the up-front loading specified in `vendor/require_vendored.rb`.
  #
  # The intention is to not change vendored libraries and to eventually
  # make adding them in optional so that distros can simply adjust their
  # packaging to exclude this directory and the various load_xxx.rb scripts
  # if they wish to install these gems as native packages.
