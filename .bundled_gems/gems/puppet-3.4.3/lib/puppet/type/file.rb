    The `file` type can manage normal files, directories, and symlinks; the

    File contents can be managed directly with the `content` attribute, or
    downloaded from a remote source using the `source` attribute; the latter
    can also be used to recursively serve directories (when the `recurse`
    attribute is set to `true` or `local`). On Windows, note that file
    contents are managed in binary mode; Puppet never automatically translates
    line endings.

      Whether (and how) file content should be backed up before being replaced.
      This attribute works best as a resource default in the site manifest
      (`File { backup => main }`), so it can affect all file resources.

      * If set to `false`, file content won't be backed up.
      * If set to a string beginning with `.` (e.g., `.puppet-bak`), Puppet will
        use copy the file in the same directory with that value as the extension
        of the backup. (A value of `true` is a synonym for `.puppet-bak`.)
      * If set to any other string, Puppet will try to back up to a filebucket
        with that title. See the `filebucket` resource type for more details.
        (This is the preferred method for backup, since it can be centralized
        and queried.)

      Default value: `puppet`, which backs up to a filebucket of the same name.
      (Puppet automatically creates a **local** filebucket named `puppet` if one
      doesn't already exist.)

      Backing up to a local filebucket isn't particularly useful. If you want
      to make organized use of backups, you will generally want to use the
      puppet master server's filebucket service. This requires declaring a
      filebucket resource and a resource default for the `backup` attribute
      in site.pp:

          # /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
          filebucket { 'main':
            path   => false,                # This is required for remote filebuckets.
            server => 'puppet.example.com', # Optional; defaults to the configured puppet master.
          }

          File { backup => main, }

      If you are using multiple puppet master servers, you will want to
      centralize the contents of the filebucket. Either configure your load
      balancer to direct all filebucket traffic to a single master, or use
      something like an out-of-band rsync task to synchronize the content on all
      masters.
