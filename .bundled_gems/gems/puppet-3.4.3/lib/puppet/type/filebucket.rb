  newtype(:filebucket) do
    @doc = <<-EOT
      A repository for storing and retrieving file content by MD5 checksum. Can
      be local to each agent node, or centralized on a puppet master server. All
      puppet masters provide a filebucket service that agent nodes can access
      via HTTP, but you must declare a filebucket resource before any agents
      will do so.

      Filebuckets are used for the following features:

      - **Content backups.** If the `file` type's `backup` attribute is set to
        the name of a filebucket, Puppet will back up the _old_ content whenever
        it rewrites a file; see the documentation for the `file` type for more
        details. These backups can be used for manual recovery of content, but
        are more commonly used to display changes and differences in a tool like
        Puppet Dashboard.
      - **Content distribution.** The optional static compiler populates the
        puppet master's filebucket with the _desired_ content for each file,
        then instructs the agent to retrieve the content for a specific
        checksum. For more details,
        [see the `static_compiler` section in the catalog indirection docs](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/indirection.html#catalog).

      To use a central filebucket for backups, you will usually want to declare
      a filebucket resource and a resource default for the `backup` attribute
      in site.pp:

          # /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
          filebucket { 'main':
            path   => false,                # This is required for remote filebuckets.
            server => 'puppet.example.com', # Optional; defaults to the configured puppet master.
          }

          File { backup => main, }

      Puppet master servers automatically provide the filebucket service, so
      this will work in a default configuration. If you have a heavily
      restricted `auth.conf` file, you may need to allow access to the
      `file_bucket_file` endpoint.
