      One or more triggers defining when the task should run. A single trigger is
      represented as a hash, and multiple triggers can be specified with an array of
      hashes.

      A trigger can contain the following keys:

      * For all triggers:
          * `schedule` **(Required)** --- The schedule type. Valid values are
            `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `once`.
          * `start_time` **(Required)** --- The time of day when the trigger should
            first become active. Several time formats will work, but we
            suggest 24-hour time formatted as HH:MM.
          * `start_date` ---  The date when the trigger should first become active.
            Defaults to "today." Several date formats will work, including
            special dates like "today," but we suggest formatting dates as
            YYYY-MM-DD.
      * For daily triggers:
          * `every` --- How often the task should run, as a number of days. Defaults
            to 1. ("2" means every other day, "3" means every three days, etc.)
      * For weekly triggers:
          * `every` --- How often the task should run, as a number of weeks. Defaults
            to 1. ("2" means every other week, "3" means every three weeks, etc.)
          * `day_of_week` --- Which days of the week the task should run, as an array.
            Defaults to all days. Each day must be one of `mon`, `tues`,
            `wed`, `thurs`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`, or `all`.
      * For monthly-by-date triggers:
          * `months` --- Which months the task should run, as an array. Defaults to
            all months. Each month must be an integer between 1 and 12.
          * `on` **(Required)** --- Which days of the month the task should run,
            as an array. Each day must beeither an integer between 1 and 31,
            or the special value `last,` which is always the last day of the month.
      * For monthly-by-weekday triggers:
          * `months` --- Which months the task should run, as an array. Defaults to
            all months. Each month must be an integer between 1 and 12.
          * `day_of_week` **(Required)** --- Which day of the week the task should
            run, as an array with only one element. Each day must be one of `mon`,
            `tues`, `wed`, `thurs`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`, or `all`.
          * `which_occurrence` **(Required)** --- The occurrence of the chosen weekday
            when the task should run. Must be one of `first`, `second`, `third`,
            `fourth`, `fifth`, or `last`.

      Examples:

          # Run at 8am on the 1st, 15th, and last day of the month in January, March,
          # May, July, September, and November, starting after August 31st, 2011.
          trigger => {
            schedule   => monthly,
            start_date => '2011-08-31',   # Defaults to 'today'
            start_time => '08:00',        # Must be specified
            months     => [1,3,5,7,9,11], # Defaults to all
            on         => [1, 15, last],  # Must be specified
          }

          # Run at 8am on the first Monday of the month for January, March, and May,
          # starting after August 31st, 2011.
          trigger => {
            schedule         => monthly,
            start_date       => '2011-08-31', # Defaults to 'today'
            start_time       => '08:00',      # Must be specified
            months           => [1,3,5],      # Defaults to all
            which_occurrence => first,        # Must be specified
            day_of_week      => [mon],        # Must be specified
