    @doc = "Manage running services.  Service support unfortunately varies
      widely by platform --- some platforms have very little if any concept of a
      running service, and some have a very codified and powerful concept.
      Puppet's service support is usually capable of doing the right thing, but
      the more information you can provide, the better behaviour you will get.

      Puppet 2.7 and newer expect init scripts to have a working status command.
      If this isn't the case for any of your services' init scripts, you will
      need to set `hasstatus` to false and possibly specify a custom status
      command in the `status` attribute.

      **Refresh:** `service` resources can respond to refresh events (via
      `notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). If a `service` receives an
      event from another resource, Puppet will restart the service it manages.
      The actual command used to restart the service depends on the platform and
      can be configured:

      * If you set `hasrestart` to true, Puppet will use the init script's restart command.
      * You can provide an explicit command for restarting with the `restart` attribute.
      * If you do neither, the service's stop and start commands will be used."

        script status actions, but Puppet only considers the difference

        If a service's init script does not support any kind of status command,
        you should set `hasstatus` to false and either provide a specific
