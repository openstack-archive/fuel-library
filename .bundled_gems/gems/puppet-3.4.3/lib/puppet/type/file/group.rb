      Which group should own the file.  Argument can be either a group
      name or a group ID.

      On Windows, a user (such as "Administrator") can be set as a file's group
      and a group (such as "Administrators") can be set as a file's owner;
      however, a file's owner and group shouldn't be the same. (If the owner
      is also the group, files with modes like `0640` will cause log churn, as
      they will always appear out of sync.)
