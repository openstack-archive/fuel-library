# This class provides a simple API for managing a lock file
# whose contents are an (optional) String.  In addition
# to querying the basic state (#locked?) of the lock, managing
# the lock (#lock, #unlock), the contents can be retrieved at
# any time while the lock is held (#lock_data).  This can be
# used to store pids, messages, etc.
#
# @see Puppet::Util::JsonLockfile

  # Lock the lockfile.  You may optionally pass a data object, which will be
  # retrievable for the duration of time during which the file is locked.
  #
  # @param [String] lock_data an optional String data object to associate
  #   with the lock.  This may be used to store pids, descriptive messages,
  #   etc.  The data may be retrieved at any time while the lock is held by
  #   calling the #lock_data method.

  # @return [boolean] true if lock is successfully acquired, false otherwise.
