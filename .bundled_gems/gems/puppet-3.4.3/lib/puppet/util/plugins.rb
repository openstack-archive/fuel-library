#
# This system manages an extensible set of metadata about plugins which it
#   collects by searching for files named "plugin_init.rb" in a series of
#   directories.  Initially, these are simply the $LOAD_PATH.
#
# The contents of each file found is executed in the context of a Puppet::Plugins
#    object (and thus scoped).  An example file might contain:
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
#      @name = "Greet the CA"
#
#      @description = %q{
#        This plugin causes a friendly greeting to print out on a master
#        that is operating as the CA, after it has been set up but before
#        it does anything.
#      }
#
#      def after_application_setup(options)
#        if options[:application_object].is_a?(Puppet::Application::Master) && Puppet::SSL::CertificateAuthority.ca?
#          puts "Hey, this is the CA!"
#        end
#      end
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Note that the instance variables are local to this Puppet::Plugin (and so may be used
#   for maintaining state, etc.) but the plugin system does not provide any thread safety
#   assurances, so they may not be adequate for some complex use cases.
