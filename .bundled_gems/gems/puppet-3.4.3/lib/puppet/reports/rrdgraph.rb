  desc "Graph all available data about hosts using the RRD library.  You
    must have the Ruby RRDtool library installed to use this report, which
    you can get from
    [the RubyRRDTool RubyForge page](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyrrdtool/).
    This package may also be available as `librrd-ruby`, `ruby-rrd`, or `rrdtool-ruby` in your
    distribution's package management system.  The library and/or package will both
    require the binary `rrdtool` package from your distribution to be installed.

    This report will create, manage, and graph RRD database files for each
    of the metrics generated during transactions, and it will create a
    few simple html files to display the reporting host's graphs.  At this
    point, it will not create a common index file to display links to
    all hosts.

    All RRD files and graphs get created in the `rrddir` directory.  If
    you want to serve these publicly, you should be able to just alias that
    directory in a web server.

    If you really know what you're doing, you can tune the `rrdinterval`,
    which defaults to the `runinterval`."
