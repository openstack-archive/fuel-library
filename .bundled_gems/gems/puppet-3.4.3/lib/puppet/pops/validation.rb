module Puppet::Pops::Validation

  # This class is an abstract base implementation of a _model validation factory_ that creates a validator instance
  # and associates it with a fully configured DiagnosticProducer.
  #
  # A _validator_ is responsible for validating a model. There may be different versions of validation available
  # for one and the same model; e.g. different semantics for different puppet versions, or different types of
  # validation configuration depending on the context/type of validation that should be performed (static, vs. runtime, etc.).
  #
  # This class is abstract and must be subclassed. The subclass must implement the methods
  # {#label_provider} and {#checker}. It is also expected that the sublcass will override
  # the severity_producer and configure the issues that should be reported as errors (i.e. if they should be ignored, produce
  # a warning, or a deprecation warning).
  #
  # @abstract Subclass must implement {#checker}, and {#label_provider}

  # An producer of diagnostics is given each issue occurrence as they are found by a diagnostician/validator. It then produces

  # This class exists to aid a diagnostician/validator which will typically first check if a particular issue
  # will be accepted at all (before checking for an occurrence of the issue; i.e. to perform check avoidance for expensive checks).
  # A validator passes an instance of Issue, the semantic object (the "culprit"), a hash with arguments, and an optional
  # exception. The semantic object is used to determine the location of the occurrence of the issue (file/line), and it
  # sets keys in the given argument hash that may be used in the formatting of the issue message.
