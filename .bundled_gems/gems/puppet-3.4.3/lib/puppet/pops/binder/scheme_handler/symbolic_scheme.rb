# Abstract base class for schemes based on symbolic names of bindings.
# This class helps resolve symbolic names by computing a path from a fully qualified name (fqn).
# There are also helper methods do determine if the symbolic name contains a wild-card ('*') in the first
# portion of the fqn (with the convention that '*' means 'any module').

  # exists as a loadable file or not. Once this method is called it is assumed that the name is relative
  # and that it should exist relative to some loadable ruby location.
  #
  # TODO: this needs to be changed once ARM-8 Puppet DSL concrete syntax is also supported.
