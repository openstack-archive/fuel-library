# A helper class that makes it easier to construct a Bindings model.
#
# The Bindings Model
# ------------------
# The BindingsModel (defined in {Puppet::Pops::Binder::Bindings} is a model that is intended to be generally free from Ruby concerns.
# This means that it is possible for system integrators to create and serialize such models using other technologies than
# Ruby. This manifests itself in the model in that producers are described using instances of a `ProducerDescriptor` rather than
# describing Ruby classes directly. This is also true of the type system where type is expressed using the {Puppet::Pops::Types} model
# to describe all types.
#
# This class, the `BindingsFactory` is a concrete Ruby API for constructing instances of classes in the model.
#
# Named Bindings
# --------------
# The typical usage of the factory is to call {named_bindings} which creates a container of bindings wrapped in a *build object*
# equipped with convenience methods to define the details of the just created named bindings.
# The returned builder is an instance of {Puppet::Pops::Binder::BindingsFactory::BindingsContainerBuilder BindingsContainerBuilder}.
#
# Binding
# -------
# A Binding binds a type/name key to a producer of a value. A binding is conveniently created by calling `bind` on a
# `BindingsContainerBuilder`. The call to bind, produces a binding wrapped in a build object equipped with convenience methods
# to define the details of the just created binding. The returned builder is an instance of
# {Puppet::Pops::Binder::BindingsFactory::BindingsBuilder BindingsBuilder}.
#
# Multibinding
# ------------
# A multibinding works like a binding, but it requires an additional ID. It also places constraints on the type of the binding;
# it must be a collection type (Hash or Array).
#
# Constructing and Contributing Bindings from Ruby
# ------------------------------------------------
# The bindings system is used by referencing bindings symbolically; these are then specified in a Ruby file which is autoloaded
# by Puppet. The entry point for user code that creates bindings is described in {Puppet::Bindings Bindings}.
# That class makes use of a BindingsFactory, and the builder objects to make it easy to construct bindings.
#
# It is intended that a user defining bindings in Ruby should be able to use the builder object methods for the majority of tasks.
# If something advanced is wanted, use of one of the helper class methods on the BuildingsFactory, and/or the
# {Puppet::Pops::Types::TypeCalculator TypeCalculator} will be required to create and configure objects that are not handled by
# the methods in the builder objects.
#
# Chaining of calls
# ------------------
# Since all the build methods return the build object it is easy to stack on additional calls. The intention is to
# do this in an order that is readable from left to right: `bind.string.name('thename').to(42)`, but there is nothing preventing
# making the calls in some other order e.g. `bind.to(42).name('thename').string`, the second is quite unreadable but produces
# the same result.
#
# For sake of human readability, the method `name` is alsp available as `named`, with the intention that it is used after a type,
# e.g. `bind.integer.named('the meaning of life').to(42)`
#
# Methods taking blocks
# ----------------------
# Several methods take an optional block. The block evaluates with the builder object as `self`. This means that there is no
# need to chain the methods calls, they can instead be made in sequence - e.g.
#
#     bind do
#       integer
#       named 'the meaning of life'
#       to 42
#     end
#
# or mix the two styles
#
#     bind do
#       integer.named 'the meaning of life'
#       to 42
#     end
#
# Unwrapping the result
# ---------------------
# The result from all methods is a builder object. Call the method `model` to unwrap the constructed bindings model object.
#
#     bindings = BindingsFactory.named_bindings('my named bindings') do
#       # bind things
#     end.model
#
# @example Create a NamedBinding with content
#   result = Puppet::Pops::Binder::BindingsFactory.named_bindings("mymodule::mybindings") do
#     bind.name("foo").to(42)
#     when_in_category("node", "kermit.example.com").bind.name("foo").to(43)
#     bind.string.name("site url").to("http://www.example.com")
