# This module contains the various producers used by Puppet Bindings.
# The main (abstract) class is {Puppet::Pops::Binder::Producers::Producer} which documents the
# Producer API and serves as a base class for all other producers.
# It is required that custom producers inherit from this producer (directly or indirectly).
#
# The selection of a Producer is typically performed by the Innjector when it configures itself
# from a Bindings model where a {Puppet::Pops::Binder::Bindings::ProducerDescriptor} describes 
# which producer to use. The configuration uses this to create the concrete producer.
# It is possible to describe that a particular producer class is to be used, and also to describe that
# a custom producer (derived from Producer) should be used. This is available for both regular
# bindings as well as multi-bindings.

#
module Puppet::Pops::Binder::Producers
  # Producer is an abstract base class representing the base contract for a bound producer.
  # Typically, when a lookup is performed it is the value that is returned (via a producer), but
  # it is also possible to lookup the producer, and ask it to produce the value (the producer may
  # return a series of values, which makes this especially useful).
  #
  # When looking up a producer, it is of importance to only use the API of the Producer class
  # unless it is known that a particular custom producer class has been bound.
  #
  # Custom Producers
  # ----------------
  # The intent is that this class is derived for custom producers that require additional
  # options/arguments when producing an instance. Such a custom producer may raise an error if called
  # with too few arguments, or may implement specific `produce` methods and always raise an
  # error on #produce indicating that this producer requires custom calls and that it can not
  # be used as an implicit producer.
  #
  # Features of Producer
  # --------------------
  # The Producer class is abstract, but offers the ability to transform the produced result
  # by passing the option `:transformer` which should be a Puppet Lambda Expression taking one argument
  # and producing the transformed (wanted) result.

  #   contribution with the highest priority is added, and the rest are ignored (unless they have the same priority in which
  #   case an error is raised).
  # - all *named* entries are handled the same way as *unnamed* but the option `:priority_on_named` controls their handling.
  # - the option `:uniq` post processes the result to only contain unique entries
  # - the option `:flatten` post processes the result by flattening all nested arrays.
  # - If both `:flatten` and `:uniq` are true, flattening is done first.
  #
  # @note
  #   Collection accepts elements that comply with the array's element type, or the entire type (i.e. Array[element_type]).
  #   If the type is restrictive - e.g. Array[String] and an Array[String] is contributed, the result will not be type
  #   compliant without also using the `:flatten` option, and a type error will be raised. For an array with relaxed typing
  #   i.e. Array[Data], it it valid to produce a result such as `['a', ['b', 'c'], 'd']` and no flattening is required
  #   and no error is raised (but using the array needs to be aware of potential array, non-array entries.
