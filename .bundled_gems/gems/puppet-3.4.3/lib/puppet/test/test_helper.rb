module Puppet::Test
  # This class is intended to provide an API to be used by external projects
  #  when they are running tests that depend on puppet core.  This should
  #  allow us to vary the implementation details of managing puppet's state
  #  for testing, from one version of puppet to the next--without forcing
  #  the external projects to do any of that state management or be aware of
  #  the implementation details.
  #
  # For now, this consists of a few very simple signatures.  The plan is
  #  that it should be the responsibility of the puppetlabs_spec_helper
  #  to broker between external projects and this API; thus, if any
  #  hacks are required (e.g. to determine whether or not a particular)
  #  version of puppet supports this API, those hacks will be consolidated in
  #  one place and won't need to be duplicated in every external project.
  #
  # This should also alleviate the anti-pattern that we've been following,
  #  wherein each external project starts off with a copy of puppet core's
  #  test_helper.rb and is exposed to risk of that code getting out of
  #  sync with core.
  #
  # Since this class will be "library code" that ships with puppet, it does
  #  not use API from any existing test framework such as rspec.  This should
  #  theoretically allow it to be used with other unit test frameworks in the
  #  future, if desired.
  #
  # Note that in the future this API could potentially be expanded to handle
  #  other features such as "around_test", but we didn't see a compelling
  #  reason to deal with that right now.

      # We go direct to the implementation because there is no safe, sane public
      # API to manage restoration of these to their default values.  This
      # should, once the value is proved, be moved to a standard API on the
      # indirector.

      # indirector.  These stubs have very specific expectations that what
