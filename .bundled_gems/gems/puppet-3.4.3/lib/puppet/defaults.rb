after CVE-2011-3872. We ignore the value completely.

For your own certificate request you can set `dns_alt_names` in the
configuration and it will apply locally.  There is no configuration option to
set DNS alt names, or any other `subjectAltName` value, for another nodes
certificate.

Alternately you can use the `--dns_alt_names` command line option to set the
labels added while generating your own CSR.

      :desc    => <<EOT,
The comma-separated list of alternative DNS names to use for the local host.

When the node generates a CSR for itself, these are added to the request
as the desired `subjectAltName` in the certificate: additional DNS labels
that the certificate is also valid answering as.

This is generally required if you use a non-hostname `certname`, or if you
want to use `puppet kick` or `puppet resource -H` and the primary certname
does not match the DNS name you use to communicate with the host.

This is unnecessary for agents, unless you intend to use them as a server for
`puppet kick` or remote `puppet resource` management.

It is rarely necessary for servers; it is usually helpful only if you need to
have a pool of multiple load balanced masters, or for the same master to
respond on two physically separate networks under different names.

An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing
requests (CSRs). You should ensure that this file does not exist on your CA
puppet master; if it does, unwanted certificate extensions may leak into
certificates created with the `puppet cert generate` command.

If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a `custom_attributes` key
and/or an `extension_requests` key. The value of each key must be a hash, where
each key is a valid OID and each value is an object that can be cast to a string.

Custom attributes can be used by the CA when deciding whether to sign the
certificate, but are then discarded. Attribute OIDs can be any OID value except
the standard CSR attributes (i.e. attributes described in RFC 2985 section 5.4).
This is useful for embedding a pre-shared key for autosigning policy executables
(see the `autosign` setting), often by using the `1.2.840.113549.1.9.7`
("challenge password") OID.

Extension requests will be permanently embedded in the final certificate.
Extension OIDs must be in the "ppRegCertExt" (`1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.1`) or
"ppPrivCertExt" (`1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.2`) OID arcs. The ppRegCertExt arc is
reserved for four of the most common pieces of data to embed: `pp_uuid` (`.1`),
`pp_instance_id` (`.2`), `pp_image_name` (`.3`), and `pp_preshared_key` (`.4`)
--- in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive names
instead of their full OID. The ppPrivCertExt arc is unregulated, and can be used
for site-specific extensions.

        The file specified in this setting may be either a **configuration file**

        treated as a config file.

        If a custom policy executable is configured, the CA puppet master will run it
