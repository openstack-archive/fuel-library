    summary "The indirector terminus to use."
    description <<-EOT
      Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet. These
      subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data
      (with the familiar actions of `find`, `search`, `save`, and `destroy`)
      from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends. In Puppet parlance,
      these backends are called terminuses.

      Almost all indirected subsystems have a `rest` terminus that interacts
      with the puppet master's data. Most of them have additional terminuses
      for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected
      subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request.

      The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but
      occasionally needs to be set explicitly. See the "Notes" section of this
      face's manpage for more details.
