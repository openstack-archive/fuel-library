# Implements the <tt>:queue</tt> abstract indirector terminus type, for storing
# model instances to a message queue, presumably for the purpose of out-of-process
# handling of changes related to the model.
#
# Relies upon Puppet::Util::Queue for registry and client object management,
# and specifies a default queue type of <tt>:stomp</tt>, appropriate for use with a variety of message brokers.
#
# It's up to the queue client type to instantiate itself correctly based on Puppet configuration information.
#
# A single queue client is maintained for the abstract terminus, meaning that you can only use one type
# of queue client, one message broker solution, etc., with the indirection mechanism.
#
# Per-indirection queues are assumed, based on the indirection name.  If the <tt>:catalog</tt> indirection makes
# use of this <tt>:queue</tt> terminus, queue operations work against the "catalog" queue.  It is up to the queue
# client library to handle queue creation as necessary (for a number of popular queuing solutions, queue
# creation is automatic and not a concern).
