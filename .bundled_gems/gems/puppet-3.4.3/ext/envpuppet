# This script provides a simple way to execute puppet and related tools
# directly from a git clone of the upstream repositories.  This allows you to
# quickly switch branches and test different versions of code without much
# friction.
#
# NOTE: There may be issues if puppet, facter, etc... are already installed
# into RUBY's site_ruby directory.  If you run into strange problems, make sure
# the correct ruby libraries are being loaded...
#
# Sample Usage:
# =============
# cd ~/src
# git clone git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet.git
# git clone git://github.com/puppetlabs/facter.git
# pushd puppet
# git checkout tags/2.6.1
# popd
# pushd facter
# git checkout tags/1.5.8
# export ENVPUPPET_BASEDIR=/home/jeff/src
# envpuppet puppet --version
# 2.6.1
# envpuppet facter --version
# 1.5.8

set -e
set -u

This command reconfigures the environment once for development.
It is designed to wrap around any other command, specifically puppet

Puppet should not be installed in site_ruby because all of \$LOAD_PATH
is searched by puppet when loading libraries and the installed version
will taint the development version

The following enviornment variables configure the behavior of envpuppet

    ENVPUPPET_BASEDIR=${HOME}/src 
      the base directory where puppet, facter, etc...  live.

    ENVPUPPET_BLEEDING=true   Enables bleeding edge prototypes like
                              puppet-interfaces

The PATH and RUBYLIB are the primary environment variables modified by
the envpuppet script.

If no arguments are given, the environment variables are printed to STDOUT
allowing the output to be sourced.  For example:

    eval \$(envpuppet)

EO_HELP
  exit 0
