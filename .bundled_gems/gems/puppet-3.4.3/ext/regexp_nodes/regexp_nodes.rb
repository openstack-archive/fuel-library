# = Synopsis
# This is an external node classifier script, after
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html
#
# = Usage
# regexp_nodes.rb <host>
#
# = Description
# This classifier implements filesystem autoloading: It looks through classes,
# parameters, and environment subdirectories, looping through each file it 
# finds.  Each file's contents are a regexp-per-line which, if they match the 
# hostname passed to the program as ARGV[0], sets a class, parameter value 
# or environment named the same thing as the file itself. At the end, the
# resultant data structure is returned back to the puppet master process as 
# yaml.
#
# = Caveats
# Since the files are read in directory order, multiple matches for a given
# hostname in the parameters/ and environment/ subdirectories will return the
# last-read value.  (Multiple classes/ matches don't cause a problem; the 
# class is either incuded or it isn't)
#
# Unmatched hostnames in any of the environment/ files will cause 'production'
# to be emitted; be aware of the complexity surrounding the interaction between
# ENC and environments as discussed in https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/3910
#
# = Examples
# Based on the example files in the classes/ and parameters/ subdirectories
# in the distribution, classes/database will set the 'database' class for 
# hosts matching %r{db\d{2}} (that is, 'db' followed by two digits) or with 
# 'mysql' anywhere in the hostname.  Similarly, hosts beginning with 'www' or 
# 'web' or the hostname 'leterel' (my workstation) will be assigned the 
# 'webserver' class.
#
# Under parameters/ there is one subdirectory 'service' which
# sets the a parameter called 'service' to the value 'prod' for production
# hosts (whose hostnames always end with a three-digit code), 'qa' for
# anything that starts with 'qa-' 'qa2-' or 'qa3-', and 'sandbox' for any
# development machines whose hostnames start with 'dev-'.
#
# In the environment/ subdirectory, any hosts matching '^dev-' and a single
# production host which serves as 'canary in the coal mine' will be put into
# the development environment
