.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-resource\fR \- The resource abstraction layer shell
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Uses the Puppet RAL to directly interact with the system\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
puppet resource [\-h|\-\-help] [\-d|\-\-debug] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-e|\-\-edit] [\-H|\-\-host \fIhost\fR] [\-p|\-\-param \fIparameter\fR] [\-t|\-\-types] \fItype\fR [\fIname\fR] [\fIattribute\fR=\fIvalue\fR \.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command provides simple facilities for converting current system state into Puppet code, along with some ability to modify the current state using Puppet\'s RAL\.
.
.P
By default, you must at least provide a type to list, in which case puppet resource will tell you everything it knows about all resources of that type\. You can optionally specify an instance name, and puppet resource will only describe that single instance\.
.
.P
If given a type, a name, and a series of \fIattribute\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs, puppet resource will modify the state of the specified resource\. Alternately, if given a type, a name, and the \'\-\-edit\' flag, puppet resource will write its output to a file, open that file in an editor, and then apply the saved file as a Puppet transaction\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir \fIdirectory\fR\' as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at http://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \'\-\-genconfig\'\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Enable full debugging\.
.
.TP
\-\-edit
Write the results of the query to a file, open the file in an editor, and read the file back in as an executable Puppet manifest\.
.
.TP
\-\-host
When specified, connect to the resource server on the named host and retrieve the list of resouces of the type specified\.
.
.TP
\-\-help
Print this help message\.
.
.TP
\-\-param
Add more parameters to be outputted from queries\.
.
.TP
\-\-types
List all available types\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Print extra information\.
.
