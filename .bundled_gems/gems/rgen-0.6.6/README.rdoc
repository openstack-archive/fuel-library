= RGen - Ruby Modelling and Generator Framework

RGen is a framework for Model Driven Software Development (MDSD)in Ruby.
This means that it helps you build Metamodels, instantiate Models, modify
and transform Models and finally generate arbitrary textual content from it.

RGen features include:
* Supporting Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7 and 1.9.x
* Metamodel definition language (internal Ruby DSL)
* ECore Meta-metamodel with an ECore instance available for every Metamodel
* Generator creating the Ruby metamodel definition from an ECore instance
* Transformer creating Ruby metamodel classes/modules from an ECore instance
* Instantiation of Metamodels, i.e. creation of Models (e.g. from XML)
* Model builder, internal Ruby DSL
* Model fragmentation over several several files and per-fragment caching
* Model Transformation language (internal Ruby DSL)
* Powerful template based generator language (internal Ruby DSL inside of ERB)
* UML 1.3 metamodel and XMI 1.1 instantiator included
* ECore XML support (XMI 2.0)
* UML-to-ECore and ECore-to-UML transformation (UML class models)
* Enterprise Architect support (UML1.3/XMI1.1)
