# A model fragment is a list of root model elements associated with a location (e.g. a file).
# It also stores a list of unresolved references as well as a list of unresolved references
# which have been resolved. Using the latter, a fragment can undo reference resolution.
#
# Optionally, an arbitrary data object may be associated with the fragment. The data object
# will also be stored in the cache.
#
# If an element within the fragment changes this must be indicated to the fragment by calling
# +mark_changed+. 
#
# Note: the fragment knows how to resolve references (+resolve_local+, +resolve_external+).
# However considering a fragment a data structure, this functionality might be removed in the
# future. Instead the fragment should be told about each resolution taking place. Use 
# method +mark_resolved+ for this purpose.
