Description: Fuel tasklib Python 2.7 module
 Fuel is an open source deployment and management tool for OpenStack. Developed
 as an OpenStack community effort, it provides an intuitive, GUI-driven
 experience for deployment and management of OpenStack, related community
 projects and plug-ins.
 .
 Fuel brings consumer-grade simplicity to streamline and accelerate the
 otherwise time-consuming, often complex, and error-prone process of deploying,
 testing and maintaining various configuration flavors of OpenStack at scale.
 Unlike other platform-specific deployment or management utilities, Fuel is an
 upstream OpenStack project that focuses on automating the deployment and
 testing of OpenStack and a range of third-party options, so it’s not
 compromised by hard bundling or vendor lock-in.
 .
 This package provides the Fuel task-lib Python module for Python 2.7.
