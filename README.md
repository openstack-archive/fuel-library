## Overview
-----------

The fuel-library is collection of Puppet modules and related code used by Fuel
to deploy OpenStack environments.


## Structure
------------

### Basic Repository Layout

```
fuel-library
├── CHANGELOG
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── MAINTAINERS
├── debian
├── deployment
├── files
├── specs
├── tests
└── utils
```

### root

The root level contains important repository documentation and license
information.

### MAINTAINERS

This is repository level MAINTAINERS file. One submitting a patch should
contact the apropriate maintainer or invite her or him for the code review.
Note, core reviewers are not the maintainers. Normally, cores do reviews
after maintainers.

### debian/

This folder contains the required information to create fuel-library debian
packages.

### deployment/

This folder contains the fuel-library Puppet code, the Puppetfile for
upstream modules, and scripts to manage modules with
[librarian-puppet-simple](https://github.com/bodepd/librarian-puppet-simple).

### files/

This folder contains scripts and configuration files that are used when
creating the packages for fuel-library.

### specs/

This folder contains our rpm spec file for fuel-library rpm packages.

### tests/

This folder contains our testing scripts for the fuel-library.

### utils/

This folder contains scripts that are useful when doing development on
fuel-library

## Granular Deployment
----------------------

The [top-scope puppet manifests](deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/modular)
(sometimes also refered as the composition layer) represent the known
deploy paths (aka supported deployment scenarios) for the
[task-based deployment](https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/reference-architecture.html#task-based-deployment).

## Upstream Modules
-------------------

In order to be able to pull in upstream modules for use by the fuel-library,
the deployment folder contains a Puppetfile for use with
[librarian-puppet-simple](https://github.com/bodepd/librarian-puppet-simple).
Upstream modules should be used whenever possible. For additional details on
the process for working with upstream modules, please read the
[Fuel library for Puppet manifests](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/How_to_contribute#Fuel_library_for_puppet_manifests)
of the [Fuel wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel).

## Testing
----------

Testing is important for the fuel-library to ensure changes do what they are
supposed to do, regressions are not introduced and all code is of the highest
quality. The fuel-library leverages existing Puppet module rspec tests,
[bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) tests for bash scripts and noop
tests for testing the module deployment tasks in fuel-library.

### Puppet module tests

Puppet rspec tests should be provided for an every module's directory included.
All of the discovered tests will be automatically executed by the
`rake spec` command issued from the repository root path.

### Bats: Bash Automated Testing System

Shell scripts residing in the `./files` directories should be
covered by the [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) test cases.
These should be put undr the `./tests/bats` path as well.
Here is an [example](https://review.openstack.org/198355) bats tests
written for the UMM feature.
See also the [bats how-to](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/bats-test-command-line-tools).

### fuel-library noop

The Noop testing framework is used for testing of the known deploy paths
with existing modular tasks. For details, see the [README](tests/noop/README.rst)
