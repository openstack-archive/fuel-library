## Overview
-----------

The fuel-library is collection of Puppet modules and related code used by Fuel
to deploy OpenStack environments.


## Structure
------------

### Basic Repository Layout

```
fuel-library
├── CHANGELOG
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── MAINTAINERS
├── debian
├── deployment
├── files
├── specs
├── tests
└── utils
```

### root

The root level contains important repository documentation and license
information.

### MAINTAINERS

This is repository level MAINTAINERS file. One submitting a patch should
contact the appropriate maintainer or invite her or him for the code review.
Note, core reviewers are not the maintainers. Normally, cores do reviews
after maintainers.

### debian/

This folder contains the required information to create fuel-library debian
packages.

### deployment/

This folder contains the fuel-library Puppet code, the Puppetfile for
upstream modules, and scripts to manage modules with
[librarian-puppet-simple](https://github.com/bodepd/librarian-puppet-simple).

### files/

This folder contains scripts and configuration files that are used when
creating the packages for fuel-library.

### specs/

This folder contains our rpm spec file for fuel-library rpm packages.

### tests/

This folder contains our testing scripts for the fuel-library.

### utils/

This folder contains scripts that are useful when doing development on
fuel-library.

## Granular Deployment
----------------------

The [top-scope puppet manifests](deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/modular)
(sometimes also referred as the composition layer) represent the known
deploy paths (aka supported deployment scenarios) for the
[task-based deployment](https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/reference-architecture.html#task-based-deployment).

## Upstream Modules
-------------------

In order to be able to pull in upstream modules for use by the fuel-library,
the deployment folder contains a Puppetfile for use with
[librarian-puppet-simple](https://github.com/bodepd/librarian-puppet-simple).
Upstream modules should be used whenever possible. For additional details on
the process for working with upstream modules, please read the
[Fuel library for Puppet manifests](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/How_to_contribute#Fuel_library_for_puppet_manifests)
of the [Fuel wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel).

## Testing
----------

Testing is important for the fuel-library to ensure changes do what they are
supposed to do, regressions are not introduced and all code is of the highest
quality. The fuel-library leverages existing Puppet module rspec tests,
[bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) tests for bash scripts and [noop
tests](https://github.com/openstack/fuel-noop-fixtures) for testing the module
deployment tasks in fuel-library.

### Module Unit Tests
---------------------

The modules contained within fuel-library require that the module dependencies
have been downloaded prior to running their spec tests. Their fixtures.yml have
been updated to use relative links to the modules contained within the
deployment/puppet/ folder.  Because of this we have updated the rake tasks for
the fuel-library root folder to include the ability to download the module
dependencies as well as run all of the module unit tests with one command. You
can run the following from the root of the fuel-library to run all module unit
tests.

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake spec
```

By default, running this command will only test the modules modified in the
previous commit. To test all modules, please run:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake spec_all
```

If you only wish to download the module dependencies, you can run the following
in the root of the fuel-library.

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake spec_prep
```

If you wish to clean up the dependencies, you can run the following in the root
of the fuel-library.

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake spec_clean
```

Once you have downloaded the dependencies, you can also just work with a
particular module using the usual 'rake spec' commands if you only want to run
a single module's unit tests. The upstream modules defined in the fuel-library
Puppetfile are automatically excluded from rspec unit tests.  To prevent non-
upstream modules that live in fuel-library from being included in unit tests,
add the name of the module to the utils/jenkins/modules.disable_rspec file.

### Module Syntax Tests
-----------------------

From within the fuel-library root, you can run the following to perform the
syntax checks for the files within fuel-library.

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake syntax
```

This will run syntax checks against all puppet, python, shell and hiera files
within fuel-library.

### Module Lint Checks

By default, Lint Checks will only test the modules modified in the previous
commit. From within the fuel-library root, you can run the following commands:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake lint
```

To run lint on all of our puppet files you should use the following commands:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake lint_all
```

This will run puppet-lint against all of the modules within fuel-library but
will skip checking the upstream module dependencies. The upstream module
dependencies are skipped by having their name in the deployment/Puppetfile
file, but also, additional modules could be defined in the
util/jenkins/modules.disable_rake-lint file.

### Puppet module tests

Puppet rspec tests should be provided for every module's directory included.
All of the discovered tests will be automatically executed by the
`rake spec` command issued from the repository root path.

### Bats: Bash Automated Testing System

Shell scripts residing in the `./files` directories should be
covered by the [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) test cases.
These should be put under the `./tests/bats` path as well.
Here is an [example](https://review.openstack.org/198355) bats tests
written for the UMM feature.
See also the [bats how-to](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/bats-test-command-line-tools).

### Fuel-library noop tests

A framework for integration testing of composition layers comprising
the modular tasks. For details, see the framework's
[documentation](http://fuel-noop-fixtures.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
