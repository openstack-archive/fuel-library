      Besides the configuration file that is managed by the module the contains
      all these related Corosync types and providers, there is a set of cluster
      op_defaults that can be set and saved inside the CIB (A CIB being a set of
      configuration that is synced across the cluster, it can be exported as XML
      for processing and backup).  The type is pretty simple interface for
      setting key/value pairs or removing them completely.  Removing them will
      result in them taking on their default value.

      More information on cluster properties can be found here:
