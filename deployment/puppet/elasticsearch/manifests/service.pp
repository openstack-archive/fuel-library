# == Class: elasticsearch::service
#
# This class exists to coordinate all service management related actions,
# functionality and logical units in a central place.
#
# <b>Note:</b> "service" is the Puppet term and type for background processes
# in general and is used in a platform-independent way. E.g. "service" means
# "daemon" in relation to Unix-like systems.
#
#
# === Parameters
#
# This class does not provide any parameters.
#
#
# === Examples
#
# This class may be imported by other classes to use its functionality:
#   class { 'elasticsearch::service': }
#
# It is not intended to be used directly by external resources like node
# definitions or other modules.
