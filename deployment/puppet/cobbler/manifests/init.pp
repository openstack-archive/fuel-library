# This class is intended to serve as
# a way of deploying cobbler server.
#
# [server] IP address that will be used as address of cobbler server.
# It is needed to download kickstart files, call cobbler API and
# so on. Required.
#
# [domain_name] Domain name that will be used as default for
# installed nodes. Required.
# [name_server] DNS ip address to be used by installed nodes
# [next_server] IP address that will be used as PXE tftp server. Required.
#
# [dhcp_start_address] First address of dhcp range
# [dhcp_end_address] Last address of dhcp range
# [dhcp_netmask] Netmask of the network
# [dhcp_gateway] Gateway address for installed nodes
# [dhcp_interface] Interface where to bind dhcp and tftp services
#
# [cobbler_user] Cobbler web interface username
# [cobbler_password] Cobbler web interface password
#
# [pxetimeout] Pxelinux will wail this count of 1/10 seconds before
# use default pxe item. To disable it use 0. Required.
