# On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
# even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
# requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of
# working even when interfaces come and go and change address. If you
# don't want dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on,
# comment this option.

# This is one of the key options. dnsmasq tries to move out servername
# and PXE filename from special fields into DHCP options.
# Some old clients can't understand those DHCP options, so they
# will not be able to boot via PXE without this option enabled.
# For example gPXE will not work while iPXE works fine.
dhcp-no-override

# for many simultaneously DHCPDISCOVVER requests dnsmasq can offer
# the same IP for two differnt MAC addresses. This option prevents it
# by assigning IPs one by one instead of using hash algorithm.
