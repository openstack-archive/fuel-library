      support right now:  Some package types (e.g., yum and apt) can

      you can use the `source` parameter to point to the correct file.

      Puppet will automatically guess the packaging format that you are
      using based on the platform you are on, but you can override it
      using the `provider` parameter; each provider defines what it
      requires in order to function, and you must meet those requirements
      to use a given provider.

      **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing the files specified as a
      package's `adminfile`, `responsefile`, or `source`, the package
      resource will autorequire those files."
