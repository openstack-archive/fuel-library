# Class: puppetdb::master::config
#
# This class configures the puppet master to use puppetdb.  This includes installing
# all of the required master-specific puppetdb packages and managing or deploying
# the necessary config files (`puppet.conf`, `routes.yaml`, and `puppetdb.conf`).
#
# ***WARNING***: the default behavior of this module is to overwrite puppet's
#  `routes.yaml` file, to configure it to use puppetdb.  If you have any custom
#  settings in your `routes.yaml` file, you'll want to pass `false` for
#  the `manage_routes` parameter and you'll have to manage that file yourself.
#
# Parameters:
#   ['puppetdb_server'] - The dns name or ip of the puppetdb server
#                          (defaults to the certname of the current node)
#   ['puppetdb_port']   - The port that the puppetdb server is running on (defaults to 8081)
#   ['manage_routes']   - If true, the module will overwrite the puppet master's routes
#                         file to configure it to use puppetdb (defaults to true)
#   ['manage_storeconfigs'] - If true, the module will manage the puppet master's
#                         storeconfig settings (defaults to true)
#   ['puppet_confdir']  - Puppet's config directory; defaults to /etc/puppet
#   ['puppet_conf']     - Puppet's config file; defaults to /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
#   ['puppetdb_version']   - The version of the `puppetdb` package that should
#                         be installed.  You may specify an explicit version
#                         number, 'present', or 'installed'.  Defaults to
#                         'present'.
#   ['restart_puppet']  - If true, the module will restart the puppet master when
#                         necessary.  The default is 'true'.  If set to 'false',
#                         you must restart the service manually in order to pick
#                         up changes to the config files (other than `puppet.conf`).
#
# Actions:
# - Configures the puppet master to use puppetdb.
#
# Requires:
# - Inifile
#
# Sample Usage:
#   class { 'puppetdb::master::config':
#       puppetdb_server          => 'my.host.name',
#       puppetdb_port            => 8081,
#   }

# TODO: port this to use params
