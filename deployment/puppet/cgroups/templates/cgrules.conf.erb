# /etc/cgrules.conf
#
#Each line describes a rule for a user in the forms:
#
#<user>                 <controllers>           <destination>
#<user>:<process name>  <controllers>           <destination>
#
#Where:
# <user> can be:
#        - an user name
#        - a group name, with @group syntax
#        - the wildcard *, for any user or group.
#        - The %, which is equivalent to "ditto". This is useful for
#          multiline rules where different cgroups need to be specified
#          for various hierarchies for a single user.
#
# <process name> is optional and it can be:
#        - a process name
#        - a full command path of a process
#
# <controller> can be:
#        - comma separated controller names (no spaces)
#        - * (for all mounted controllers)
#
# <destination> can be:
#        - path with-in the controller hierarchy (ex. pgrp1/gid1/uid1)
#
# Note:
# - It currently has rules based on uids, gids and process name.
#
# - Don't put overlapping rules. First rule which matches the criteria
#   will be executed.
#
# - Multiline rules can be specified for specifying different cgroups
#   for multiple hierarchies. In the example below, user "peter" has
#   specified 2 line rule. First line says put peter's task in test1/
#   dir for "cpu" controller and second line says put peter's tasks in
#   test2/ dir for memory controller. Make a note of "%" sign in second line.
#   This is an indication that it is continuation of previous rule.
#
#
#<user>         <controllers>   <destination>
#
#john          cpu              usergroup/faculty/john/
#john:cp       cpu              usergroup/faculty/john/cp
#@student      cpu,memory       usergroup/student/
#peter         cpu              test1/
#%             memory           test2/
#@root          *               admingroup/
#*              *               default/
