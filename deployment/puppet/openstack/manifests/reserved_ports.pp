#
# Configure kernel reserved ephemeral ports
# (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1353363)
#
# Specify the ports which are reserved for known
# third-party applications. These ports will not
# be used by automatic port assignments (e.g. when
# calling connect() or bind() with port number 0).
#
# Parameters
#
# [*ports*]
# Comma separated list of ranges to be reserved
#
# Examples:
# class { 'openstack::reserved_ports': }
#

class openstack::reserved_ports ( $ports = '49000,49001,35357,41055,41056,55572,58882' ) {
  sysctl::value { 'net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports': value => $ports }
}
